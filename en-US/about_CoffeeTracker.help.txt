SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Track your ☕️

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Do you have a Community Pot at Work? Is it pay per Cup, like mine? But, who
    always has a Quarter on them for one Cup!? Do you sometimes lose track of
    what you have contributed and don't know if you can pull another Cup of Joe?
    With CoffeeTracker, you now can! 🕺
    Initialize your CoffeeTracker with the cost of your coffee per cup in
    Dollars or Cents. Then, simply tell CoffeeTracker when you either `-Add`
    monies or `-Take` Coffees. You can then poll the tracker for your Coffee Cup balance.
    CoffeeTracker uses json files to track how much 💰 you have dropped into the
    pot and how much coffee you have taken out of the pot.
    You can initialize your json file in two ways:
    1. On Module Load! The Module takes two arguments, `-Create` and `-Path`.
    Both are optional. `-Create` is a switch, so pass it `$true` if you want to
    create a CoffeeTracker.json file in the default location, your `$Home`
    folder. You can pass a fully resolved path with the second argument to set
    the initial path if you don't want to use the default location. You can also
    set `-Create` to `$false` and still change the default path. Examples below. 2.
    With `New-CoffeeTracker`, which is just a fancy wrapper for `New-Item`. You
    can set your initial price with `-Cost` and `-Unit` (which can only be
    `Dollar` or `Cent`).

EXAMPLES
    Import-Module CoffeeTracker -ArgumentList $true
    Import-Module CoffeeTracker -ArugmentList $true, c:\Somewhere\else
    Import-Module CoffeeTracker -ArgumentList $false, c:\MyCoffeeTracker.json
    New-CoffeeTracker -Path C:\Somwhere -Cost 25 -Unit Cent
    New-CoffeeTracker -Path $Home -Name TrackThatCoffee.json -Cost 1 -Unit
    Dollar

NOTE
    Note: you cannot set your initial price with from Module initialization! So
    you will have to go into your json file and manually edit that. Default
    values are `$false` and `$env:USERPROFILE/CoffeeTracker.json`.
