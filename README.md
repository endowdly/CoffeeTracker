# CoffeeTracker ‚òïÔ∏è

Do you have a Community Pot at Work? Is it pay per Cup, like mine? But, who always has a Quarter on them for one Cup!? Do you sometimes lose track of what you have contributed and don't know if you can pull another Cup of Joe? 

With CoffeeTracker, you now can! üï∫

Initialize your CoffeeTracker with the cost of your coffee per cup in _Dollars_ or _Cents_. Then, simply tell CoffeeTracker when you either `-Add` monies or `-Take` Coffees. You can then poll the tracker for your _Coffee Cup_ balance.

## How

CoffeeTracker uses json files to track how much üí∞ you have dropped into the pot and how much coffee you have taken out of the pot.

You can initialize your json file in two ways:

1. On Module Load! The Module takes two arguments, `-Create` and `-Path`. Both are optional. `-Create` is a switch, so pass it `$true` if you want to create a CoffeeTracker.json file in the default location, your `$Home` folder. You can pass a fully resolved path with the second argument to set the initial path if you don't want to use the default location. You can also set `-Create` to `$false` and still change the default path. Examples below. Note: you cannot set your initial price with this method! So you will have to go into your json file and manually edit that. Default values are `$false` and `$env:USERPROFILE/CoffeeTracker.json`.

2. With `New-CoffeeTracker`, which is just a fancy wrapper for `New-Item`. You can set your initial price with `-Cost` and `-Unit` (which can only be `Dollar` or `Cent`).

### Examples

```powershell
Import-Module CoffeeTracker -ArgumentList $true   # Default path file creation
Import-Module CoffeeTracker -ArugmentList $true, c:\Somewhere\else    # Make the file somewhere else
Import-Module CoffeeTracker -ArgumentList $false, c:\MyCoffeeTracker.json   # I already have a file here

New-CoffeeTracker -Path C:\Somwhere -Cost 25 -Unit Cent
New-CoffeeTracker -Path $Home -Name TrackThatCoffee.json -Cost 1 -Unit Dollar    # Do you work at Starbuckss!? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
```

You can create as many trackers as you'd like. This can be useful if you have two different pots or if you have a price change.

You can set the current tracker with `Set-CoffeeTracker`.

## What

Windows PowerShell 3.0+. I don't see why this wouldn't necessarily work with PowerShell Core, but I haven't really looked at it or tested it.
